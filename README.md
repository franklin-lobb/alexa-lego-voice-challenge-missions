# alexa-lego-voice-challenge-missions

The 'missions' here are designed to be used as a part of the [Lego MINDSTORMS Voice Challenge: Powered by Alexa](https://www.hackster.io/contests/alexa-lego-voice-challenge)

The Alexa skill code contained here was tested using Python 3.7, which matches the Alexa Hosted Skill environment. Unless otherwise noted, these samples are ported version of the supplied Node.js samples. Interaction models have been included for convenience.

## Using these skills

To use this code, when creating your Alexa skill, choose the **Python Alexa Hosted** option instead of Node.js when selecting the hosting option. Use the the **lambda_function.py** file in the mission folder to update the one hosted with your skill code, and also update the **requirements.txt** file based on the one in the mission folder. The version of the code included here does not use the utils.py file, so it does not need to be updated (nor does it hurt anything to leave it there).

The interaction model (used on the Build tab), is included for your convenience.

## Notes

A revised Mission 4 may (or may) not be in the works. :bowtie:
