# alexa-lego-voice-challenge-missions

The 'missions' here are designed to be used as a part of the [Lego MINDSTORMS Voice Challenge: Powered by Alexa](https://www.hackster.io/contests/alexa-lego-voice-challenge)

The supplied sample code has Alexa Skills which are written in Node.js. These are those skills ported to Python.

A revised Mission 4 may (or may) not be in the works. :bowtie:
